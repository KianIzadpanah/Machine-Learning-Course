## Practical HW's and Project

### Sharif University of Technology

### Spring 2024

- HW1:

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Implemented a `SGD Perceptron` from scratch
  - Implemented a `Naive Bayes classifier` from scratch to predict the presence of heart disease in the patient
  - Explored model's accuracy on imbalanced dataset
  - Implemented `Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)` and `Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)` from scratch

- HW2:

  - Implemented `Polynomial Regression` to model the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable
  - Applied `Regularization` techniques to refine the predictions

- HW3:

  - Implemented `Soft Margin SVM` and converted the convex optimization problem to a standard Quadratic Program (QP) form
  - Implemented `Multi-class SVM` with different kernels from scratch

- HW4:

  - Implemented a Neural Net to do a classification on bank marketing dataset
  - Implemented the `K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN)` from scratch

- HW5:

  - Implemented the `KMeans Clustering` from scratch and used Elbow method and Silhouette method to choose optimal cluster numbers
  - Implemented the `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` from scratch

- Project:
  - Implemented a `CNN` from scratch and used it as the Edge Detection model
  - Implemented the `Neural Style Transfer (NST)` from scratch
